## Purpose of Template-Builder was:
0. I needed a way to make responsive HTML/CSS designs
1. In order to achieve 0, I used an open source tool called, <a href="https://grapesjs.com/">GrapesJS</a>. Which made things a lot easier to get started
2. With 1. built, I integrated <a href="https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction">UIKit</a> for neat HTML/CSS responsive designs
3. Now that everything was setup simply add an automatic saving system with GrapesJS


## Interface
